This crash course focuses on software engineering tools and methodologies to write better tested, documented code that is easier to understand and maintain. We will probe:

- documentation: [exercise](README_DOC.md)
- static analysis: [exercise](README_STATIC.md)
- tests: [exercise](README_TEST.md)
- automation: [exercise](README_AUTO.md)

The examples are based on the Python programming language, but it is meant to be general.
