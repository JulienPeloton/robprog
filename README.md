# Robust Programming

This crash course will focus on software engineering tools and methodologies to write better tested, documented code that is easier to understand and maintain. We will probe:

- documentation: [exercise](README_DOC.md)
- tests
- static analysis
- automation

The examples are based on the Python programming language, but it is meant to be general.
